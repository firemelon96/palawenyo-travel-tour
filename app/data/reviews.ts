      "I had my tour yesterday. It was great!!!! The people were nice, helpful, friendly, and they are very responsive. I availed the super ultimate tour with a freediving buddy since I am still a beginner in freediving. Sir Naem was very knowledgeable and he takes good gopro diving videos. He would teach you how to improve your dives and breathing techniques to lengthen my dives.PS. The kayak rental is not really worth it since they only allow kayaking in a few spots from super ultimate tour.Planning on booking another tour with them during my stay! Thank you Palawenyo Travel and Tours I had a great time",
